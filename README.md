## Appendix

Within the scope of Integrative Project was proposed to do a project in one specialization of electronics course.

Object detection is a huge part of any system. It consumes a lot of resources and computational time, so the system will be slower and the performance won't be the best. This project aims to accelerate that part, but more directly to license plates.

To achieve that, the ZCU104 development board was used. It has a quad-core ARM® Cortex™-A53 applications processor, dual-core Cortex-R5 real-time processor, Mali™-400 MP2 graphics processing unit, 4KP60 capable H.264/H.265 video codec and 16nm FinFET+ programmable logic which will be necessary to the project development.

The system is hybrid, so there is a software part and hardware part. The costume Linux image was generated with petaLinux.


## Installation

1- Download the PrHa project to your local machine


To test it on your local machine
```bash
  Check if the compiler is the gcc one in the Makefile
  Type make in console

```
